# hw-4-fighttime
This a very base level figthing game. It stores the characters in object everything that you see on the screen is created with jquery and then appended to the html. I put the objects into a array to make them eaiser to access and to set the divs with the correct health, damage and names. Each div has a id set to the characters name which is what allows me to move the divs to different areas and subtract health, add damage and check who is alive via that id. The game uses if statements to check who is still alive after each press of the fight button. Also each hero gets a small attack boost everytime you hit the fight button. It varies for each character to allow for limited paths to victory. To start the game you select a hero and then the first villian you want to fight and keep hitting the fight button until someone losses. If you win you select another villian to fight if you lose after the end game audio you can hit reset button to play again. I used some basic bootstrap and Jquery to make this game. I am the only developer on this project so everything you see is my creation. 
here are the win paths for each character. 
Aragorns win path Gimli Gandalf Legolas
Gimli win path Aragorn then any order 
Legolas win path Gimli Gandalf Aragorn 
Gandalf win path Gimli Aragorn Legolas
