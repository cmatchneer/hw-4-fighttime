# hw-4-fighttime
This is a very base level fighting game. It stores the characters in an object, everything that you see on the screen is created with jquery and then appended to the html. I put the objects into an array to make them easier to access and to set the divs with the correct health, damage and names. Each div has an id set to the characters name which is what allows me to move the divs to different areas and subtract health, add damage and check who is alive via that id. The game uses if statements to check who is still alive after each press of the fight button. Also each hero gets a small attack boost everytime you hit the fight button. It varies for each character to allow for limited paths to victory. To start the game you select a hero and then the first villain you want to fight and keep hitting the fight button until someone loses. If you win you select another villain to fight if you lose after the end game audio you can hit the reset button to play again. I used some basic bootstrap and Jquery to make this game. I am the only developer on this project so everything you see is my creation. Here are the win paths for each character. 
Aragorn’s win path Gimli, Gandalf, Legolas 
Gimli’s win path is Aragorn then any order 
Legolas’s win path is Gimli, Gandalf, Aragorn 
Gandalf’s win path is Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas
